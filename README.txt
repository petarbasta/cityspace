Hello!

This is an app I created for the City University of Hong Kong 2019 hackathon
that won 3rd place.

The app is made to help you find a space to study on campus easily.
It uses AI tools from a python backend that can detect how many people are in a
room, and the updates the Xcode frontend to let you know which rooms are empty. 

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did :)
